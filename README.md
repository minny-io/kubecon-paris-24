# Minecraft Meets Kubernetes
Crafting Future Developers on a Pixelated Playground

In this repository we collect some additional Information for you.



## Minecraft Education
You can find most of the information about Minecraft Education on their [Website](https://education.minecraft.net/).

If you would like to have a chat with someone already familiar with the program, you can reach our for help.


If you want to become a Minecraft Education teacher yourself, you should have a look at the [Minecraft Teacher Academy](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/trainings/my-minecraft-journey). Here you can find many different courses that will enable you.

## The Hobbyfarm Project
For some of our workshops we use [Hobbyfarm](https://github.com/hobbyfarm/hobbyfarm) to provide coding and server environments. That way we can combine tutorials together with the neccessary technical environment. Users only need a browser to get access.
